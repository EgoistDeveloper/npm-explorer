# [NPM Explorer](https://zitros.github.io/npm-explorer)

Online file explorer for [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
Visit [zitros.github.io/npm-explorer](https://zitros.github.io/npm-explorer).

The main purpose of this service is to improve quality of NPM packages, primarily because many people
publish a lot of unnecessary files to NPM (like CI configs, tests, build tools or even whole repositories).
This service helps to see what files does NPM package include along with some other metrics regarding
to the package quality.

You can easily hotlink packages and individual files, for example:

```txt
https://zitros.github.io/npm-explorer/?p=lodash/LICENSE
```
